REloAD – Responsible E-Waste Logistics and Disposal

Project Description
REloAD (Responsible E-waste Logistics and Automated Disposal) is a tech-driven solution designed during the Walmart Sparkathon (Hackathon) to address the rising issue of electronic waste (e-waste) by enabling smarter, more efficient, and traceable disposal and recycling mechanisms.

This project aims to integrate AI, geospatial analysis, and data science into the e-waste lifecycle to help organizations and consumers dispose of electronic waste responsibly while optimizing logistics and compliance reporting.

Problem Statement
E-waste is one of the fastest-growing waste streams globally. Current disposal methods are often inefficient, untraceable, and lack incentives for responsible recycling. Walmart, being a global retailer, has both a responsibility and an opportunity to build scalable, sustainable waste management solutions.

Solution Highlights
A platform to connect consumers, collection centers, and recyclers

AI-based e-waste type recognition using image input

Route optimization for pickup logistics

Integration with tracking systems to ensure transparency

Reward system to incentivize responsible disposal

Features
Smart user interface for logging and scheduling pickups

AI-based waste categorization from user-uploaded images

Geo-mapping of nearest certified e-waste collection centers

Logistics dashboard for vehicle route optimization

Real-time tracking and reporting of waste flow

Technologies Used
Python

Flask or Streamlit (for prototyping the interface)

OpenCV / TensorFlow (for waste type recognition)

Google Maps API or Folium (for geo-visualization)

Firebase / MongoDB (for backend and storage)

Hackathon Impact
Built a working prototype in 24–48 hours

Demonstrated real-world application of AI in sustainability and logistics

Addressed a UN SDG (Sustainable Development Goal) through tech

Collaborated with a multi-disciplinary team

Screenshots (Optional)
Add UI screenshots, map interfaces, waste image prediction examples here.
